# Analytics â€” Abiola

## Purpose & User Value

The Analytics module provides comprehensive insights into beat performance, user engagement, and sales metrics. Users can track plays, likes, downloads, and sales for their beats, with detailed analytics cards and recent sales information. The module enables data-driven decision making for content creators.

## Current Frontend Flow

### Main routes/components involved:
- **Dashboard Analytics**: `src/modules/dashboard/components/` - analytics dashboard components
- **Beat Stats**: Integrated with beat detail and user library views
- **Analytics Cards**: Display performance metrics and trends
- **Recent Sales**: Sales history and transaction information
- **User Stats**: User profile and performance metrics

### State management and key hooks:
- Analytics data fetched through API calls with caching
- Real-time updates for play counts and engagement metrics
- Historical data tracking and trend analysis
- User-specific analytics and performance insights

### How the UI calls services/handlers:
- Beat analytics accessed through `/api/v1/beat/stats` endpoint
- Play tracking via `/api/v1/beat/:id/plays` (PATCH) endpoint
- Like tracking via `/api/v1/beat/:id/likes` (PATCH) endpoint
- Download tracking via `/api/v1/beat/:id/downloads` (PATCH) endpoint
- Sales tracking via `/api/v1/beat/:id/sales` (PATCH) endpoint

## Current Backend/API Flow

### Handlers/routes involved:
- **Beat Routes**: `src/routes/v1/beat.routes.ts` - analytics tracking endpoints
- **Beat Controller**: `src/modules/beat/beat.controller.ts` - analytics operations
- **Beat Service**: `src/modules/beat/beat.service.ts` - analytics logic and database operations
- **Beat Model**: `src/modules/beat/beat.model.ts` - analytics data structure

### Auth/ownership checks expected:
- JWT token validation for user-specific analytics
- User ownership verification for beat analytics access
- Public access for play tracking and engagement metrics
- Rate limiting for analytics tracking endpoints

### DB collections/documents touched:
- **beats** collection - analytics data (plays, likes, downloads, sales)
- **users** collection - user statistics and performance metrics
- **purchases** collection - sales data and transaction history
